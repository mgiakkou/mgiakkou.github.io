The recognition of notified electronic identification became mandatory in 2018. Yet, there is no requirement for Member States to develop a national electronic identification and to make it interoperable with those in other Member States. This has led to discrepancies between countries. The new Regulation on digital identity addresses shortcomings in eIDAS by improving the effectiveness of the framework and extending its benefits to the private sector. Member States will offer citizens and businesses digital wallets that will be able to link various aspects of their national digital identities. These may be provided by public authorities or the private sector, if they are recognized by the Member States.</p> <p>The EU Digital Identity Wallet will be:</p> <ul> <li>made available to anyone who wants to use it:\u00a0 Any EU citizen, resident, and business in the EU who would like to make use of the EU\u00a0Digital Identity will be able to do so.</li> <li>used widely: EU\u00a0Digital Identity Wallets will be used as a way to identify users when providing them with access to public and private digital services across the EU.</li> <li>controlled by users: The EU Digital Identity Wallets will enable people to choose and keep track of their identity, data and certificates which they share with third parties.

This could make the software slower, less reliable, or more vulnerable to attacks than mature software.</li> <li>The initial development release is not yet comprehensively documented.</li> <li>Users of the software must perform sufficient engineering and additional testing in order to properly evaluate their application and determine whether any of the open-sourced components is suitable for use in that application.</li> <li>We strongly recommend to not put this version of the software into production use.</li> <li>Only the latest version of the software will be supported</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#architecture-and-reference-framework","title":"Architecture and Reference Framework","text":"<p>On 3 June 2021, the European Commission adopted a Recommendation calling on Member States to work towards the development of a a common toolbox including a technical Architecture and Reference Framework a set of common standards and technical specifications and a set of common guidelines and best practices.</p> <p>The new Regulation specifies that these outcomes will serve as a basis for the implementation of the proposal for a European Digital Identity Framework, without the process of developing the Toolbox interfering with, or prejudging the legislative process.</p> <p>The new Regulation foresees that the Toolbox is developed by Member States\u2019 experts in the eIDAS Expert Group  in close coordination with the Commission and, where relevant for the functioning of the European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet infrastructure, other concerned public and private sector parties.</p> <p>The current authoritative version is tagged as release/tag in this repository.</p> <p>The EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation below is built based on the Architecture Reference Framework.</p>"},{"location":"#wallet-reference-implementation-open-source-code","title":"\u2b50Wallet Reference Implementation - Open Source Code","text":"<p>\ud83d\ude80 EUDI Wallet open source code is now available online.

Section 6.4 describes interactions between these roles in the lifecycle of a Relying Party, namely registration, and possibly de-registration.</p> <p>Finally, Section 6.6 describes interactions in the lifecycle of a PID or an attestation, namely issuance, presentation to a Relying Party or to another Wallet Instance, management, and deletion.</p> <p>Notes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>This trust model is conceptual and may be implemented by Member     States in different ways. For example, the different Trusted Lists     may be implemented as a single list, provided that this list clearly     indicates which trust anchors can be used for which purposes.     Similarly, a Member State may decide to combine multiple Registrars     and/or Certificate Authorities into a single entity, again provided     that that entity maintains clear separations between its different     roles and responsibilities. In some case, existing entities can     probably be used to fulfil these roles.</p> </li> <li> <p>This trust model does not presume a specific implementation. In     particular, the use of term 'certificate' does not imply a specific     format. Depending on implementation, it may be an X.509 certificate     or another format specified in the context of any other trust     framework. Similarly, a 'Certificate Authority' may be implemented     as a 'classical' X509-based CA according to [RFC5280] and     [RFC3647], or as a trusted third party binding public keys to     entities in any other trust framework.</p> </li> <li> <p>This trust model is valid for both remote and proximity use cases.     However, technical measures taken to ensure that the requirements on     trust are fulfilled may differ between these two use cases.     Moreover, the authentication and authorisation mechanisms will     depend on the characteristics of the interacting parties.</p> </li> <li> <p>In this version of the ARF, the trust model does not yet include     interactions needed to enable Users to create qualified electronic     signatures or seals.

One possible way to set up such an authenticated channel is by ensuring the authenticity and integrity (but not the non-repudiation) of the attributes by means of a Message Authentication Code (MAC). The MAC is created by the secure environment over the presented attribute values. The MAC key is generated from an ephemeral key of the Relying Party (sent to the secure environment by the Wallet Instance) in combination with an ephemeral key created by the secure environment.

In other words, the Relying Party trusts the PID Provider or Attestation Provider to have verified, during PID or attestation issuance, that the User device is fit to receive a PID or attestation, as described in Section 6.6.2.3. The Relying Party therefore does not assess the technical properties of the User device and WSCD during the attestation presentation process. If the Relying Party were to make its own independent assessment of the security of the User device, there is a possibility that it would not accept a User's attestation even though it is perfectly valid.

User binding prevents an attacker from presenting a PID or an attestation that they are not legally allowed to use.</p> <p>The mechanism(s) available for User binding depend on the presentation flow type (proximity or remote, supervised or unsupervised, see also Section 4.2.3), and on the attributes issued to the User by the PID Provider or Attestation Provider.</p> <p>In the first place, the Relying Party can always decide to trust the User authentication mechanisms implemented by the Wallet Instance and the WSCD (see [Topic 9]). This means that the Relying Party trusts that the Wallet Instance and the WSCD have properly authenticated the User before allowing the User to present the attributes. Note that:</p> <ul> <li> <p>This trust is not based on the outcome of any verification by the     Relying Party but is a-priori trust in (in particular) the certified     WSCD used by the Wallet Instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Using this method implies that Relying Parties also trust device     binding, as described in Section 6.5.3. The Relying Party Instance     in fact first verifies that the PID or attestation is bound to a     WSCD trusted by the PID Provider or Attestation Provider, and then     trusts that the Wallet Instance and the WSCD have properly     authenticated the User.</p> </li> <li> <p>As a matter of fact, this User authentication method will always be     carried out, since a Wallet Instance must authenticate its User when     asking for User approval for presenting any attributes, and since     device binding is also mandatory.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In addition, in some cases, if a Relying Party does not want to only trust the above mechanism, it may be able to use User attributes to carry out User authentication. For example, if the PID or attestation contains a User portrait, the Relying Party may be able to visually or biometrically compare that portrait to the face of the person presenting the attestation or by a photo taken of it (by an automated machine or by a \"selfie\"). This will generally be possible in supervised proximity presentations by human inspection, or in an unsupervised proximity flow if equipped with the appropriate equipment It may also be possible to do this in unsupervised presentations by using face recognition technology, possibly even remotely. However, to generate trustworthy outcomes in such situations, special conditions are required, such as good lighting, clear instructions for the User for positioning their face and an approved liveness detection mechanism supporting Presentation Attacks Detection (PAD).</p> <p>Lastly, if the person presenting the PID or attestation is able to present an identity document, the Relying Party may be able to authenticate the User by comparing attributes from the PID or attestation, such as first and last name, to those in the identity document. However, this requires that the Relying Party can verify that the identity document really belongs to the person presenting it. In practice this will often mean that the identity document is a photo ID, and the presentation must consequently be done in proximity and be supervised, or done remotely and supported by PAD.</p>"},{"location":"eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/docs/arf/#6639-relying-party-verifies-combined-presentation-of-attributes","title":"6.6.3.9 Relying Party verifies combined presentation of attributes","text":"<p>According to the Regulation, a combined presentation of attributes is a request for attributes from two or more attestations in the same action.

In the short-term, the IA of Article 5c(6) will be established, laying the groundwork for the creation of transitory national certification schemes. Consequently, building upon the foundation of the IA and transitory schemes, a dedicated CSA certification scheme for the EUDI Wallets will be established by ENISA.</p>"},{"location":"eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/docs/arf/#721-certification-of-eudi-wallet-solutions-in-the-short-term","title":"7.2.1 Certification of EUDI Wallet Solutions in the short term","text":"<p>Until a dedicated EUDI Wallets cybersecurity certification scheme under the CSA is available, the Regulation allows Member States to establish national certification schemes (following Article 5c(3)). Following Article 5c(6) of the Amending Regulation, an IA should be established which will serve as a harmonised guideline for the development of these transitory national certification schemes. It will leverage the use of relevant and existing CSA certification schemes by establishing specifications, procedures and reference technical standards for certification. This can include procedures and methods on how to derive evaluation activities from an architecture analysis, as well as a reference certification or a minimum set of risks to be mitigated.</p> <p>The guiding principles will take into consideration the composite nature of the EUDI Wallets, as well as the potential different architectures considering that the amending Regulation is technology and architecture neutral. Guidance on certification will allow for various proposed architecture models (including components, security functions, threats, mitigations), evaluation of their individual components (design, implementation, and effectiveness), and related risks as reflected through a common risk registry defined by the RA (see also Section 7.4).</p> <p>The IA will refer to standards, and where available, relevant European CSA schemes must be used. Currently, only the EUCC scheme for the cybersecurity certification of the ICT products, parts, or components for products<sup>3</sup> is available. For those cybersecurity requirements not covered by the EUCC, its supporting documents or an extended version of the EUCC, and for the non-cybersecurity requirements, the use of the ISO/IEC 17065<sup>4</sup> framework under Regulation (EC) 765/2008<sup>5</sup> is foreseen as the harmonised standard for certification.

In addition, an architecture survey has been conducted in the Toolbox Expert Group to gain insights into potential EUDI Wallet implementations and architectural possibilities.</p> <p>First, the RA aims to identify initial security and privacy threats (potential attacks carried out by different actors) and provide a list of assets which must be protected against the identified threats (critical, non-critical). The risks will provide input to a common risk registry, listing the minimum set of risks that should be addressed by Member States' implementations (see also Section 7.4).

It outlines the high-level process requirements for certification, in addition to high-level statements on the functional components of the EUDI Wallet. In essence, it defines 'what' will need to be certified and what the process steps will be.

This mapping can include European, national, and other global schemes, in relation to the defined certification requirements (i.e., functional, process, privacy and security certification requirements).</p> <p>Fourth, once the mapping has been performed, it will be used as a basis for the development of certification schemes for EUDI Wallets, both at the national and European levels. The schemes will rely on the identified certification schemes to provide assurance, either in a composite approach, or through the establishment of assumptions on external components, such as the Wallet users' devices.</p> <p>Finally, non-cybersecurity requirements should ensure functional interoperability of the EUDI Wallet.

To determine this, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider needs to know (among other things) if the Wallet Instance offers the functional capabilities required by the PID Provider or Attestation Provider in its PID or attestation issuing policy. In addition, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider needs to know if the Wallet Secure Cryptographic Application(s) (WSCA) and the corresponding Wallet Secure Cryptographic Device(s) (WSCD) used by the Wallet Instance offer the required level of security. Therefore, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider needs to receive trustworthy information about these capabilities and security posture.\u00a0</p> <p>This Topic introduces an information object that contains the necessary information. This object is called the Wallet Trust Evidence (WTE). The WTE contains a public key. By including this public key in the WTE, the Wallet Provider attests that the corresponding private key is protected by a certified WSCA/WSCD that has the properties and security posture described in the WTE. The PID Provider or Attestation Provider then asks that WSCA to create a key pair for its new PID or attestation, and to prove that this new key is associated with the key in the WTE. Association primarily means that the PID or attestation private key is protected by the same WSCA as the WTE private key. A full description of the concept of key association is given in the forthcoming White Paper on Wallet Trust Evidence. Therefore, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider can be sure that the security level of the new PID or attestation key is the same as the security level of the WTE key.\u00a0At the moment of writing this version of the ARF, it is not fully clear how many WSCDs will support the cryptographic functionalities necessary to generate a proof of association. Therefore, the creation of a proof of association in a WSCA is recommended (SHOULD), not required (SHALL). In this way, once a Wallet Instance has access to a WSCD/WSCA that supports the required cryptographic functionalities, proofs of association can be used as described in this Topic.</p> <p>Please note that the scope of this document is limited to the question of how the WTE is issued during Wallet Instance activation and how it is used during attestation issuance.

Creating the WTE during Wallet Instance activation</p> Index Requirement WTE_01 A Wallet Provider SHALL have to activate a new Wallet Instance before a User can use it to obtain an attestation. WTE_02 A WSCA SHALL authenticate the User before performing any cryptographic operation involving a private or secret key of a Wallet Instance (i.e., a WTE key) or of an attestation in a Wallet Instance. WTE_03 A Wallet Instance SHALL authenticate the User before performing any operation excluding cryptographic operations. The Wallet Instance MAY rely on a WSCA certified to be compliant with applicable requirements for level of assurance \"high\" to do so, but MAY also rely on other components. <p>Note: Cryptographic operations can only be performed by the WSCA after User authentication according to WTE_02. WTE_04 For a Wallet Instance containing a natural-person PID, the User mentioned in WTE_02 and WTE_03 SHALL be the natural person who is the subject of that PID. WTE_05 For a Wallet Instance containing a legal-person PID, the User mentioned in WTE_02 and WTE_03 SHALL be a natural person appointed by the legal person who is the subject of that PID. <p>Note: This requirement does not imply that the actions of a legal-person Wallet Instance cannot be automated, or that the person(s) controlling the Wallet Instance must authenticate every time the Wallet Instance presents an attestation or creates a seal. The intent is that every operation performed by the legal-person Wallet Instance is performed under the responsibility of a natural person. WTE_06 A Wallet Provider SHALL only activate a new Wallet Instance if it has verified that: <ul><li>The Wallet Instance has access to at least one WSCA that is certified to be compliant with applicable requirements in this Topic, for level of assurance \"high\". In addition, the Wallet Instance MAY have access to one or more other WSCAs.</li><li>The private key corresponding to the public key in the WTE (see WTE_07) is protected by the respective WSCA.</li></ul> WTE_07 During the activation of a new Wallet Instance, a Wallet Provider SHALL sign at least one Wallet Trust Evidence (WTE) and issue it to the Wallet Instance. WTE_08 The Commission SHALL take measures to ensure that the contents, format and encoding of the Wallet Trust Evidence is specified in a technical specification. Each WTE SHALL describe the Wallet Instance and a certified WSCA available to that Wallet Instance, in such a way that a PID Provider or Attestation Provider processing the WTE is able to take a well-grounded decision on whether to issue an attestation to that Wallet Instance and WSCA. Notes: <ul><li>In general, a PID Provider or Attestation Provider will also need information about the User. Such information is not contained in the WTE.</li><li>The WTE does not contain information allowing a PID Provider or Attestation Provider to verify whether the WTE (and by extension the Wallet Instance) is revoked. Revocation information for the Wallet Instance is instead included in the WIA defined in [Topic 38].</li></ul> WTE_09 A Wallet Provider SHALL consider all relevant factors, including the risk of a WTE public key becoming a vector to track the User, when deciding on the validity period of a WTE. A Wallet Provider MAY use short-lived WTEs to mitigate such risks. WTE_10 A WSCA SHALL generate a new key pair for a new WTE on request of the Wallet Provider via the Wallet Instance. The WSCA SHALL register the new key as a WTE key in an internal registry. The WSCA SHALL register the WTE key as an independent (i.e., non-associated) key in an internal registry. <p>Note: A WTE key can be associated later with a PID or attestation key when that PID or attestation key is created, see WTE_13. WTE_11 A WTE SHALL contain a public key, and the corresponding private key SHALL be generated by the WSCA described in the WTE. <p>Note: A WTE key pair is generated as per WTE_10. WTE_12 In case the Wallet Provider must update the WTE because the information in the WTE is outdated, the Wallet Provider SHALL ensure that the Wallet Instance only releases the latest version of a WTE to an Attestation Provider. <p>B.

This indication can either be direct, by providing the WTE public key value, or indirect, by providing a public key value that has been associated with the WTE key previously. In the latter case, the WSCA SHALL look up the associated WTE key in its internal registry. The WSCA SHALL register the new key in an internal registry as an attestation key. The WSCA SHALL register the association between the new private key and the WTE private key in an internal registry. Notes: <ul><li>Direct indication of the WTE is used in case a PID Provider or Attestation Provider indicates during issuing that the new PID or attestation must be associated with a WTE public key, see WTE_15 and WTE_16.</li><li>Indirect indication of the WTE key is used in case an Attestation Provider indicates during issuing that the new attestation must be associated with an existing PID or attestation, see WTE_16.</li></ul> WTE_14 During PID or attestation issuance, a WSCA SHALL prove possession of the private key corresponding to the new PID or attestation public key, on request of the PID Provider or Attestation Provider via the Wallet Instance, for example by signing a challenge with that private key. WTE_15 A PID Provider SHALL indicate to a WSCA (via the Wallet Instance) the public key to which the new PID must be associated. This SHALL be a WTE public key. WTE_16 An Attestation Provider SHALL indicate to a WSCA (via the Wallet Instance) the public key to which the new attestation must be associated. This SHALL be either a WTE public key or the public key of a PID or attestation that already exists in the Wallet Instance. <p>Note: if the Attestation Provider indicates a PID or attestation public key, this is an indirect indication of a WTE key, see WTE_13. WTE_17 During PID or attestation issuance, a WSCA SHALL prove possession of the private key corresponding to a WTE public key on request of a PID Provider or Attestation Provider via the Wallet Instance, for example by signing a challenge with that private key. WTE_18 During PID or attestation issuance, a WSCA SHOULD generate a proof of association for two or more public keys, if and only if the corresponding private keys are protected by the same WSCA and the WSCA has internally registered an association between these private keys. Notes: <ul><li>It is possible that some private keys in a WSCA are not associated with each other, even though they are managed within the same WSCA.</li><li>If two keys are associated, this implies that they are both associated with the same WTE key.

WTE_21 During PID or attestation issuance, a Wallet Instance SHALL provide the PID Provider or Attestation Provider with the WTE describing the properties of the WSCA that generated the new PID or attestation private key and protects it. WTE_22 If a Wallet Instance has access to multiple WSCAs, it SHALL register which PIDs and attestations are bound to each of these WSCAs. <p>C.

Overview: Requirements for a WSCA</p> <p>The technical requirements above imply the following requirements for a WSCA.</p> Index Requirement WTE_28 A WSCA SHALL be able to verify the authentication factors of a User, in accordance with the requirements in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1502 Section 2.2.1. WTE_29 A WSCA SHALL be able to generate a new key pair on request of the Wallet Instance. WTE_30 A WSCA SHALL be able to prove possession of the private key corresponding to a public key on request of a Wallet Instance, for example by signing a challenge with that private key. WTE_31 A WSCA SHALL register each newly generated key pair as either a WTE key or an attestation key, depending on information provided by the Wallet Instance in the key generation request. The internal registry used by the WSCA for this purpose SHALL be protected against modification by external parties. WTE_32 A WSCA SHALL protect a private key it generated during the entire lifetime of the key. This protection SHALL at least imply that the WSCA prevents the private key from being extracted in the clear. If a WSCA is able to export a private key in encrypted format, the key used for key encryption SHALL be properly protected, for example as multiple key shares controlled by multiple key custodians. WTE_33 A WSCA SHALL associate each newly generated attestation key with a WTE key indicated by the Wallet Instance. The WSCA SHALL record the association between these keys in an internal registry, which SHALL be protected against modification by external parties. WTE_34 For the purposes of WTE_33, a Wallet Instance SHALL indicate the WTE key either directly, by WTE public key value, or indirectly, by value of a public key that is already associated to the intended WTE key. In the latter case, the WSCA SHALL look up the intended WTE key in its registry. WTE_35 A WSCA SHALL consider two keys to be associated if they are associated to a common WTE key. WTE_36 A WSCA SHOULD be able to generate a proof of association for two or more public keys. The WSCA SHALL generate such a proof if and only if the corresponding private keys are protected by that WSCA, and the WSCA has internally registered an association between these private keys."},{"location":"eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements/#a2310-topic-10-issuing-a-pid-or-attestation-to-the-eudi-wallet","title":"A.2.3.10 Topic 10 - Issuing a PID or Attestation to the EUDI Wallet","text":"<p>Also containing Topic 23 - PID issuance and Attestation issuance</p> <p>Short description</p> <p>PID Providers and Attestation Providers issue PIDs and attestations to EUDI Wallet Instances.

WIRevocation_03 The Commission SHALL ensure that a Rulebook for the WIA is created in accordance with all requirements in Topic 12. WIRevocation_04 The Wallet Provider SHALL manage the issuance processes for WIAs in such a way that the WIAs cannot be misused by colluding Relying Parties (and Attestation Providers) to track a User. WIRevocation_05 During the activation process of a Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider SHALL do the following to ensure that a User can request revocation of their Wallet Instance as mentioned in WIRevocation_10: <ul><li>Register the relationship between this Wallet Instance and its User in a User account;</li><li>Enable secure authentication of the User towards the Wallet Provider is possible, by providing one or more suitable authentication mechanisms. These authentication mechanisms SHALL NOT depend on the mobile device containing the Wallet Instance.</li></ul><p>  Note: <ul><li>The Wallet Provider does not need to know the true identity of the User. Instead, an alias such as an e-mail address can be used.</li><li>The reason for requiring authentication mechanisms that are independent of the Wallet Instance is that the User must be able to authenticate to the Wallet Provider even in case the mobile device containing the Wallet Instance is lost or stolen.</li></ul> <p>A.  Revoking a Wallet Instance\u00a0</p> Index Requirement specification WIRevocation_06 A Wallet Provider SHALL be able to suspend a Wallet Instance, by suspending its WIA(s) as specified in [Topic 7]. WIRevocation_07 A Wallet Provider SHALL be able to revoke a Wallet Instance, by revoking its WIA(s) as specified in [Topic 7]. WIRevocation_08 A Wallet Provider SHALL be able to unsuspend a Wallet Instance, by unsuspending its WIA(s). WIRevocation_09 During the lifetime of a Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider SHALL regularly verify that the security of the Wallet Instance is not breached or compromised. If the Wallet Provider detects a security breach or compromise, the Wallet Provider SHALL analyse its cause(s) and impact(s). If the breach or compromise affects the trustworthiness or reliability of the Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider SHALL suspend the corresponding WIA(s) if they have a validity period of 24 hours or more. The Wallet Provider SHALL do so at least in the following circumstances: <ul><li>If the security of the Wallet Instance, or the security of the mobile device and OS on which it is installed, or the security of a WSCA it uses for managing cryptographic keys and sensitive data, is breached or compromised in a manner that affects its trustworthiness or reliability.</li><li>If the security of the Wallet Solution is breached or compromised in a manner that affects the trustworthiness or reliability of all corresponding Wallet Instances.</li><li>If the security of the common authentication and data protection mechanisms used by the Wallet Instance is breached or compromised in a manner that affects their trustworthiness or reliability.</li><li>If the security of the electronic identification scheme under which the Wallet Instance is provided is breached or compromised in a manner that affects its trustworthiness or reliability.</li></ul> WIRevocation_10 A Wallet Provider SHALL revoke a Wallet Instance upon the explicit request of the User registered during the Wallet Instance activation process, see WIRevocation_05. To do so, the Wallet Provider SHALL revoke all valid WIA(s) for that Wallet Instance, if they have a validity period of 24 hours or longer. The Wallet Provider SHALL authenticate the User before revoking the Wallet Instance. WIRevocation_11 A Wallet Provider SHALL revoke a Wallet Instance upon the explicit request of a PID Provider, in case the natural person using the Wallet Instance has died or the legal person using the Wallet Instance has ceased operations. To do so, the Wallet Provider SHALL revoke all valid WIA(s) for that Wallet Instance, if they have a validity period of 24 hours or longer. To identify the Wallet Instance that is to be revoked, the PID Provider SHALL use the Wallet Instance identifier provided by the Wallet Provider in the WTE during PID issuance. WIRevocation_12 Before revoking a WIA per WIRevocation_11, the Wallet Provider SHALL verify that the party requesting revocation is indeed a valid PID Provider listed in the Trusted List of PID Providers. WIRevocation_13 Before requesting a Wallet Provider to revoke a Wallet Instance per WIRevocation_11, the PID Provider SHALL ensure that the revocation does not harm the interests of any of the stakeholders. The PID Provider SHALL have (and follow) a documented policy to ensure that this is the case. <p>A.  Informing the User</p> Index Requirement specification WIRevocation_14 A Wallet Provider SHALL inform a User without delay in case the Wallet Provider decided to suspend or revoke the User's Wallet Instance. The Wallet Provider SHALL also inform the User about the reason(s) for the suspension or revocation. This information SHALL be understandable for the general public. It SHALL include (a reference to) technical details about any security breach if applicable. WIRevocation_15 A Wallet Provider SHALL inform a User without delay in case the Wallet Provider decided to unsuspend the User's Wallet Instance. WIRevocation_16 To inform a User about the (un)suspension or revocation of their Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider SHALL use a communication channel that is independent of the Wallet Instance. In addition, the Wallet Provider MAY use the Wallet Instance itself to inform the User. <p>B.  Verifying the revocation status of a Wallet Instance\u00a0</p> Index Requirement specification WIRevocation_17 A Wallet Instance SHALL be able to transfer the WIA to PID Providers and Attestation Provider during the issuance of a PID or attestation and to Relying Parties during the presentation of attributes. WIRevocation_18 A PID Provider or Attestation Provider SHOULD, for each of its valid PIDs or attestations, regularly verify whether the Wallet Provider suspended or revoked the Wallet Instance on which that PID or attestation is residing. If it turns out that the Wallet Instance is suspended or revoked, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider SHOULD immediately revoke the respective PID or attestation in accordance with all requirements in [Topic 7]. WIRevocation_19 A Relying Party SHOULD verify the revocation status of the Wallet Instance by requesting and verifying a WIA and subsequently verifying the revocation status of the WIA following the steps specified per VCR_09. WIRevocation_20 For the verification of WIAs, a Relying Party SHALL accept the trust anchors in the Wallet Provider Trusted List(s) of all Member States. <p>Note: Wallet Provider Trusted Lists are explained in [Topic 31]. WIRevocation_21 When no reliable information regarding the revocation status of a WIA is available, a Relying Party SHOULD perform a risk analysis considering all relevant factors for the use case, before taking a decision to accept or refuse the Wallet Instance."},{"location":"eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements/#a2339-topic-39-wallet-to-wallet-technical-topic","title":"A.2.3.39 Topic 39 - Wallet to wallet technical Topic","text":"<p>There are no HLRs for this Topic.</p>"},{"location":"eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements/#a2340-topic-40-reserved","title":"A.2.3.40 Topic 40 - Reserved","text":""},{"location":"eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements/#a2341-topic-41-minimum-requirements-on-pub-eaas-rulebooks","title":"A.2.3.41 Topic 41 - Minimum requirements on PuB-EAAs rulebooks","text":"<p>See topic 12.</p>"},{"location":"eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements/#a2342-topic-42-requirements-for-qtsps-to-access-authentic-sources","title":"A.2.3.42 Topic 42 - Requirements for QTSPs to access authentic sources","text":"<p>Short description</p> <p>This topic discusses the ability of QTSPs of electronic attestations of attributes to verify those attributes by electronic means at the request of the user, wherever those attributes rely on Authentic Sources within the public sector.\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>HLRs</p> Index Requirement specification QTSPAS_01 Member States SHALL define:  <ul><li>discovery mechanisms that enable QTSPs to request information about the Authentic Sources or designated intermediaries recognized at national level (including the attributes about a natural or legal person that the Authentic source or designated intermediary is considered to be a primary source or recognised as authentic in accordance with Union law or national law, including administrative practice);</li><li>procedures for QTSPs to request the verification of attributes from Authentic Sources,</li><li>in accordance with technical specifications referred to in QTSPAS_07, and that comply with QTSPAS_02.</li></ul> QTSPAS_02 Authentic Sources or designated intermediaries SHALL make available an interface that:  <ul><li>determines whether a verification request for attributes comes from a QTSP of electronic attestation of attributes (so a lookup in the QTSP Trusted List);</li><li>determine whether the QTSP issues the requested attributes, and those attributes rely on an Authentic Source within the public sector;</li><li>if both requirements are met: determine the identity of the user (presumably via a Wallet or any other eIDAS identity scheme to determine the request);</li><li>determine whether the User has given consent;</li><li>after authentication of the user: verify whether the claimed attributes match the info in the authentic source; and finally</li><li>respond with a 'match' or 'no match' for each attribute.</li></ul> <p>The Commission SHALL take measures to ensure that this interface is specified.<p>  Note: Every QTSP will be able to verify against every authentic source.
