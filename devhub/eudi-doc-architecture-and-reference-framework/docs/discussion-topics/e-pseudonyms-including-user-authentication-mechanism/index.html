<h1 id="e-pseudonyms-including-user-authentication-mechanism">E - Pseudonyms, including User authentication mechanism</h1>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="11-discussion-paper-topic-description">1.1 Discussion Paper Topic Description</h3>
<p>This document is the Discussion Paper for eIDAS Coordination Group regarding Topic E: Pseudonyms, including User authentication mechanism.
The ARF Development Plan [ARF_DevPlan] describes this Topic as follows:</p>
<p><em>High-level requirements for pseudonyms in the ARF need to be further detailed, including
specifying the use cases where pseudonyms should be applied.</em></p>
<h3 id="12-key-words">1.2 Key Words</h3>
<p>This document uses the capitalized key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as specified in RFC 2119, i.e., to indicate requirements, recommendations and options specified in this document.
In addition, 'must' (non-capitalized) is used to indicate an external constraint, for instance a self-evident necessity or a requirement that is mandated by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability, whereas other words, such as 'will', 'is' or 'are' are intended as statements of fact.</p>
<h3 id="13-document-structure">1.3 Document Structure</h3>
<p>The document is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapter 2 presents the legal requirements for functionality related to pseudonyms.</p>

<h2 id="2-legal-requirements-for-pseudonyms">2 Legal Requirements for Pseudonyms</h2>
<p>There are two legal texts that impose direct requirements on the pseudonym functionality of the Wallet Units: [CIR.2024.2979] and [eiDAS 2.0].
Below we recap the respective legal requirements from these sources.</p>
<h3 id="21-eidas-20-about-pseudonyms">2.1 [eIDAS 2.0] about Pseudonyms</h3>
<p>There are two main requirements in [eIDAS 2.0] about Pseudonyms in relation to Wallet Units:
1. Wallet Units must be able to generate pseudonyms and store them encrypted.
2. Relying Parties must accept identification via pseudonyms when there are no legal requirements for identification.</p>
<p>Below are the actual excerpts from the law including the recitals that establish these requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Recital (19)</strong></p>
<p><em>... Reliance on the legal identity should not hinder European Digital Identity Wallet users to access services under a pseudonym, where there is no legal requirement for legal identity for authentication. ...</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (22)</strong></p>
<p><em>European Digital Identity Wallets should include a functionality to generate user-chosen and managed pseudonyms, to authenticate when accessing online services.</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (57)</strong></p>
<p><em>Where very large online platforms within the meaning of Article 33(1) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council require users to be authenticated in order to access online services, those platforms should be required to accept the use of European Digital Identity Wallets upon the voluntary request of the user. Users should be under no obligation to use a European Digital Identity Wallet to access private services and should not be restricted or hindered in their access to services on the grounds that they do not use a European Digital Identity Wallet. However, if users wish to do so, very large online platforms should accept them for that purpose, while respecting the principle of data minimisation and the right of the users to use freely chosen pseudonyms. ...</em></p>
<p><strong>Recital (60)</strong></p>
<p><em>Unless specific rules of Union or national law require users to identify themselves, accessing services by using a pseudonym should not be prohibited.</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 5 Pseudonyms in electronic transaction</strong></p>
<p><em>Without prejudice to specific rules of Union or national law requiring users to identify themselves or to the legal effect given to pseudonyms under national law, the use of pseudonyms that are chosen by the user shall not be prohibited.</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 5a European Digital Identity Wallets</strong></p>
<p><em>... 4.  European Digital Identity Wallets shall enable the user, in a manner that is user-friendly, transparent, and traceable by the user, to:
...
(b) generate pseudonyms and store them encrypted and locally within the European Digital Identity Wallet;
...</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 5b European Digital Identity Wallet-Relying Parties</strong></p>
<p><em>9. ... Relying parties shall not refuse the use of pseudonyms, where the identification of the user is not required by Union or national law. ...</em></p>
<p>Additionally, pseudonyms are mentioned in Article 32 and Annex IV about the validation of qualified electronic signatures and certificates. Note that the use of pseudonyms in this article is orthogonal to the notion of pseudonyms used for authentication as discussed in this discussion paper.</p>
<h3 id="22-cir20242979-about-pseudonyms">2.2 [CIR.2024.2979] about Pseudonyms</h3>
<p>[CIR.2024.2979] specifies three main requirements for pseudonyms:
1. [WebAuthN] defines the technical specification for pseudonyms.
2. The pseudonyms the wallet generates must be unique for each Relying Party.
3. The pseudonyms can be used either stand alone or in combination with other attested attributes.</p>
<p>Below are the actual excerpts from the law including the recitals that establish these requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Recital (14)</strong></p>
<p><em>The generation of wallet-relying party specific pseudonyms should enable wallet users to authenticate themselves without providing wallet-relying parties with unnecessary information. As set out in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, wallet users are not to be hindered from accessing services under a pseudonym, where there is no legal requirement for legal identity for authentication. Therefore, the wallets are to include a functionality to generate user-chosen and managed pseudonyms, to authenticate when accessing online services. The implementation of the specifications set out in Annex V should enable these functionalities accordingly. Further, wallet-relying parties are not to request users to provide any data other than those indicated for the intended use of wallets in the relying party register. Wallet users should be enabled to verify the registration data of relying parties at any point in time.</em></p>
<p><strong>Article 14</strong></p>
<p><em>1. Wallet units shall support the generation of pseudonyms for wallet users in compliance with the technical specifications set out in Annex V.
2. Wallet units shall support the generation, upon the request of a wallet-relying party, of a pseudonym which is specific and unique to that wallet-relying party and provide this pseudonym to the wallet-relying party, either standalone or in combination with any person identification data or electronic attribute attestation requested by that wallet-relying party.</em></p>
<p><strong>Annex V:</strong></p>
<p><em>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR PSEUDONYM GENERATION REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 14

Technical specifications:

— WebAuthn – W3C Recommendation, 8 April 2021, Level 2, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/REC-webauthn-2-20210408/">https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/REC-webauthn-2-20210408/</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="3-use-cases">3 Use Cases</h2>
<p>Below, we elaborate on the use cases inferred from the above legal requirements.
The distinction between the two use cases follows from Article 14 2. [CIR.2014.2979].</p>
<p>Both use cases are described in an online non-proximity-based setting where the pseudonyms are presented towards services over the internet.</p>
<h3 id="31-use-case-a-pseudonymous-authentication">3.1 Use Case A: Pseudonymous Authentication</h3>
<p>Pseudonyms can be used to authenticate a user when it is not necessary for a Relying Party to learn the identity of a user.</p>
<p>Concretely, the use case is as follows:
1. A user registers a pseudonym at a Relying Party using their Wallet Unit.
2. The user can afterwards do a series of interactions with this Relying Party.
3. If the user at a later point wishes to build upon previous interactions with this Relying Party they should then be able to authenticate with the pseudonym used for registering. Thereby, the user "logs in" to the same account at the Relying Party.
The user uses their Wallet Unit to perform this authentication.</p>
<h3 id="32-use-case-b-presentation-of-attributes-with-subsequent-authentication-using-pseudonyms">3.2 Use Case B: Presentation of Attributes with Subsequent Authentication using Pseudonyms</h3>
<p>Similarly, to above a user wishes to create an account with an associated pseudonym that can be used for subsequent authentication at later sessions.
However, in this scenario the user would like to register verifiable attributes in the form of either Person Identification Data (PID), Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes (QEAAs), or Electronic Attestation of Attributes (EAAs) while registering.</p>
<p>Concretely, the use case goes as follows:
1. A user registers a pseudonym and presents PID or (Q)EAAs to a Relying Party using their Wallet Unit.
2. The user can afterward do a series of interactions with this Relying Party.
3. If the user at a later point wishes to build upon previous interactions with this Relying Party they should then be able to authenticate with the pseudonym used for registering. Thereby, the user "logs in" to the same account at the Relying Party.
The user uses their Wallet Unit to perform this authentication.</p>
<h3 id="33-questions-related-to-use-cases">3.3 Questions Related to Use Cases</h3>
<p>Below, we list open questions that must still be clarified related to the above two use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Should any other use cases be supported?</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> For both use cases: Should both cross-device and same-device flows be supported?
I.e., should registration and authentication with pseudonyms be possible both when a user initiates the interactions with the Relying Party from the same device and with a device different from the one hosting the Wallet Unit? The answer to this question will impose requirements on the interfaces between the Wallet Unit and the client a user initiates the interaction with.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> For Use Case A: Should a single user be able to use their Wallet Unit to present several different pseudonyms to a single Relying Party? High-Level Requirements must be defined that enforces the answer to this question.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> For both use cases: What assurances must be given to the Relying Party? Such possible assurance exists on at least three levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>No assurances are given to the Relying Party. I.e., the Relying Party is not even guaranteed that it is interacting with the Wallet Unit.</li>
<li>The Relying Party is assured that the private key corresponding to the pseudonym being stored/authenticated <em>was</em> originally stored in a Wallet Unit.</li>
<li>The Relying Party is assured that the private key corresponding to the pseudonym being stored/authenticated <em>is</em> stored in a non-revoked Wallet Unit.</li>
<li>For use case B: The Relying Party is assured that the private key corresponding to the pseudonym used to authenticate is stored on the same Wallet Unit as originally presented PID/(Q)EA.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that, because the technical implementation of pseudonyms must rely on [WebAuthN], the possibility for achieving such assurances is to use attestations (for an explanation of this see Chapter 4).
Therefore, higher assurances comes with a trade-off in terms of surveillance risks.
For a further discussion of these risks see Chapter 5.1.</p>
<h2 id="4-high-level-approach-to-pseudonyms">4 High-Level Approach to Pseudonyms</h2>
<p>As specified in [CIR.2024.2979], [WebAuthN] defines the technical specification for pseudonyms.
The technology underlying [WebAuthN] is commonly refereed to as passkeys.</p>
<h3 id="41-introduction-to-passkeys">4.1 Introduction to Passkeys</h3>
<p>Passkeys are to be seen as an alternative to passwords.
The idea is that a user, when registering a user account at a service generates a public-private key pair, registers the public key at the service, and can then subsequently use the private key to authenticate towards the service at later points in time.
In a bit more detail, the flow for using such passkeys follows the following blueprint.</p>
<p><strong>Registration:</strong>
1. The user generates a public-private keypair and stores both public and private keys at their secure device (referred to as an authenticator).
2. The user registers the public key at the desired service.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication:</strong>
1. When a user wishes to authenticate towards a service, the service will send them a challenge consisting of a random number.
2. The user uses the private key stored on their secure device to sign the challenge and sends this back to the service.
3. The service verifies that the signature on the challenge verifies using the preregistered public key. If the signature verifies as expected, the user is considered authenticated and thereby granted access to the service.</p>
<h3 id="42-overview-of-webauthn">4.2 Overview of [WebAuthN]</h3>
<p>[WebAuthN] defines an API for the creation and use of passkeys. Conceptually, in addition to the user, there are four different logical components in this specification:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relying Party Server:</strong> The Relying Party that wishes to offer a service based on authentication using passkeys.</li>
<li><strong>Relying Party Client:</strong> The program provided by the Relying Party that runs in the client of the user and communicates with the Relying Party Server.</li>
<li><strong>Client:</strong> The client that the user uses to interact with the Relying Party's server.</li>
<li><strong>Authenticator:</strong> The device controlled by the user to create, store, and use the passkeys.</li>
</ul>
<p>[WebAuthN] defines a model dividing the responsibilities between these different entities and defines an interface between the Relying Party Client and the Client. Additionally, it defines a challenge/response protocol to authenticate with passkeys.
The interface is referred to as the <em>WebAuthnAPI</em>.
However, [WebAuthN] does not specify how the Authenticator and the Client must communicate.
We briefly discuss the relation to Topic F in Chapter 5.</p>
<p>The Wallet Unit will act as an Authenticator in this setting.</p>
<p>Note that the Relying Party Client and the Client are two programs that are executed on the same physical machine.</p>
<p>[WebAuthN] relies on several different types of identifiers including: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relying Party ID:</strong> An identifier unique to the Relying Party which must be a valid domain string. This what the user will identify the Relying Party by and let the Authenticator learn which Relying Party is asking for registration/authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Credential ID:</strong> A unique identifier chosen by the Authenticator for each passkey. </li>
<li><strong>User ID:</strong> An identifier unique to each user that is assigned by the Relying Party. This will be provided to the Authenticator when registering a new passkey and subsequently provided by the Relying Party to indicate to the Authenticator which passkeys are requested. The Authenticator will keep track of which passkeys are available for which User IDs and Relying Party IDs. The Relying Party keeps track of a User Name for each User ID.</li>
<li><strong>User Display Name:</strong> An alias that may be chosen by the user or the Relying Party and assigned to a specific passkey on the Authenticator. This allows the user to easily distinguish and select which passkey they want to authenticate with if several are present. </li>
</ul>
<p>Below we elaborate on how the different components work together to allow the registration and subsequent authentication using passkeys.</p>
<h4 id="421-registration">4.2.1 Registration</h4>
<p>The flow for registering a passkey in [WebAuthN] is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Relying Party Server creates a challenge and sends this along with the User ID, the Relying Party ID, and the User Display Name to the Relying Party Client.</li>
<li>The Relying Party Client forwards the information to the Client using the WebAuthnAPI.</li>
<li>The Client checks that the Relying Party ID is consistent with the caller's origin and forwards the information to the Authenticator along with other contextual data.</li>
<li>The Authenticator authenticates the user (for example using a PIN or via biometrics). It then generates a new key pair with a new Credential ID and set the scope of this to the specific Relying Party ID and User ID. Finally, the Authenticator generates and "attestation" (explained below) and sends this as well as the public key and its Credential ID to the Client</li>
<li>The Client then forwards the information to the Relying Party Client that again forwards it to the Relying Party Server.</li>
<li>The Relying Party Server verifies the attestation and registers the received public key for this User ID.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that Authenticator stores the public key pair in a way such that it is scoped uniquely to a specific Relying Party aligning with the requirements of [CIR.2024.2979], Article 14 2, which states that the pseudonyms must be unique to each Relying Party.</p>
<p>The term attestation is here used differently than elsewhere in the ARF.
In this context, the attestation is not about attributes of the user, but rather about attributes of the Authenticator and is to ensure the Relying Party that they are talking with an Authenticator with certain attributes.
The attestation often takes the form of a signature on the challenge as well as some other contextual data.</p>
<p>In [WebAuthN], four different types of attestations are mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Basic Attestation:</strong> The Authenticator has a single master public/private key stored.
This is used to sign all attestations and a certificate on the public key is included in the attestation data to allow the Relying Party to verify the signature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attestation CA:</strong> Similar to the above in the sense that the Authenticator has a single master public/private key stored. However, instead of using this to attest pass keys, they use this to authenticate towards a Certificate Authority (CA), which is then configured to issue certificates to the Authenticator on multiple attestation key pairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anonymization CA:</strong> Similar to the above except that it is explicit that the Authenticator requests a certificate for a new attestation key pair per generated passkey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self Attestation:</strong> The attestation is signed with the private key of the newly generated key pair in the passkey.
  Note that this does not give any guarantees for the Relying Party about which authenticator they are interacting with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Attestation Statement:</strong> No attestation is given.
  Note that this does not give any guarantees for the Relying Party about which authenticator they are interacting with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We note that Article 5a 5 a viii of [eIDAS 2.0] states  "<em>European Digital Identity Wallets shall, in particular support common protocols and interfaces: ... for relying parties to verify the authenticity and validity of European Digital Identity Wallets;...</em>". The latter two forms of attestation do not align with this requirement.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5.1, we discuss how the other relates to previously identified privacy risks about user surveillance (see also Topic A).</p>
<h4 id="422-authentication">4.2.2 Authentication</h4>
<p>The flow for authenticating using a passkey following [WebAuthN] is:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Relying Party Server creates a challenge and sends this along with its Relying Party ID to the Relying Party Client.</li>
<li>The Relying Party Client Client forwards the information to the browser using the WebAuthnAPI.</li>
<li>The Client checks that the Relying Party ID is consistent with the caller's domain and forwards the information to the Authenticator along with other contextual data.</li>
<li>The Authenticator authenticates the user (for example using a PIN or via biometrics).
   It then prompts the user to select one of the passkeys scoped to this Relying Party ID. For this step the User Display Name can be presented to the user.
   Finally, the private key of the chosen key pair is used to sign the challenge as well as some contextual data including the User ID, Credential ID, and the Relying Party ID. 
   This is then sent to the Client.</li>
<li>The Client then forwards the information to the Relying Party Client that again forwards it to the Relying Party Server.</li>
<li>The Relying Party Server verifies the signature with its stored public key for this User ID and Credential ID and depending on the outcome of this verification considers the user authenticated.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="43-challenges">4.3 Challenges</h3>
<p>Below we list challenges related to the use of [WebAuthN] as the technical specification for pseudonyms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attestations may be linkable (see discussion in Chapter 5.1 and also Topic A) depending on the chosen type of attestation.</li>
<li>The information about the Relying Party is verified only by the Client and not by the Authenticator itself.
  This may be a problem as in Article 5a 5 a vii [eIDAS 2.0] it is stated that "<em>European Digital Identity Wallets shall, in particular ... ensure that the relying parties can be authenticated and identified by implementing authentication mechanisms in accordance with Article 5b;...</em>".</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-relation-to-other-topics">5 Relation to Other Topics</h2>
<p>Below we discuss how pseudonyms relate to the other topics being discussed.</p>
<h3 id="51-privacy-risks-and-mitigations">5.1 Privacy Risks and Mitigations</h3>
<p>Topic A - Privacy Risks and Mitigations discusses surveillance risks related to presenting Person Identification Data (PID) and (Qualified) Electronically Attested Attributes (Q)EAA.
Similar, concerns are relevant for the pseudonyms functionality defined by the [WebAuthN] specification.
In fact, from a linkability perspective, there are only minor differences between the attestations present in the registration flow of [WebAuthN] and other attestations such as PID and (Q)EAAs.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5.3 we discuss how this relates to the risks and threats identified in the [RiskRegister].</p>
<p>Below we consider two different types of linkability concerns for the attestation types summarized in Chapter 4.2.1 namely Relying Party Linkability and CA Linkability.
The latter form of linkability is similar to what is dubbed Attestation Provider Linkability in the discussion Paper for Topic A, but there is a mismatch between the use of the word "attestation" in the broader ARF framework and in [WebAuthN] and to avoid confusion we, therefore, use a different wording here.</p>
<h4 id="511-relying-party-linkability">5.1.1 Relying Party Linkability</h4>
<p>Relying Party Linkability is the ability for Relying Parties to link together multiple authentications performed by a user using a Wallet Unit.
Note that it is inherent for the use cases that the same Relying Party must be able to link together multiple presentations of a pseudonym as it must be unique per Relying Party.
However, two or more Relying Parties should not be able to infer any information about whether they have interacted with one or multiple users by comparing multiple authentications using pseudonyms.</p>
<p>To prevent this, it is necessary to ensure there are no unique (per Wallet Unit) presented to multiple different Relying Parties. Depending on the attestation form used for Registration (see Chapter 4.2.1) this may or may not be the case for [WebAuthN].</p>
<p>If <em>Basic Attestations</em> are used where each wallet unit holds only one attestation key pair and corresponding certificate, the public key of this attestation key pair may be exactly such unique value that is presented to multiple Relying Parties.
In [WebAuthN] it is suggested to ensure that multiple different Authenticators hold the same attestation key pair thereby no longer making it a unique value for correlation.
We note that letting several different units share the same private key is against best practices, as it increases the risk of keys being compromised.</p>
<p>If an <em>Attestation CA</em> is used to issue certificates on multiple attestation keys, the degree to which Relying Parties can correlate the different certificates can be reduced. However, as long as attestation keys are used more than once, the Relying Parties can still deduce <em>some information</em> by correlating registrations of Pseudonyms.
The mitigation is similar to the proposals of Method B and Method C (Limited-time Attestations and Rotating-batch Attestations) from the discussion paper on topic A.</p>
<p>If an <em>Anonymization CA</em> is used to issue certificates on single-use-only attestation keys, Relying Parties are not able to correlate information about multiple presentations.
We refer to this as being <em>Relying Party unlinkable</em>.</p>
<p>Neither <em>Self Attestation</em> nor <em>No Attestation</em> allows Relying Parties to correlate information about multiple presentations of pseudonyms. That is they are Relying Party unlinkable.</p>
<h4 id="512-ca-linkability">5.1.2 CA Linkability</h4>
<p>Certificate Authority (CA) linkability is the ability to track a user's interactions at several different Relying Parties by combining the information from those Relying Parties with information from CAs (in case such exists).</p>
<p>Note that all the attestation types that are Relying Party linkable also are CA linkable by definition as the information available to CAs and Relying Parties is a superset of the information available only to multiple Relying Parties.</p>
<p>Both the types <em>Attestation CA</em> and <em>Anonymization CA</em> are CA linkable as CAs can store which public key that issue certificates to and share with which Wallet Unit. By correlating this with the information available at the Relying Parties it is possible to track how the different Wallet Unit uses the pseudonym functionality.</p>
<p>Neither <em>Self Attestation</em> nor <em>No Attestation</em> includes any information from a CA and Relying Parties are not able to correlate information about multiple presentations of pseudonyms with this form of attestation type. That is they are both also CA unlinkable.</p>
<h4 id="513-drawbacks-of-different-attestation-types">5.1.3 Drawbacks of Different Attestation Types</h4>

<h3 id="52-wallet-unit-attestations">5.2 Wallet Unit Attestations</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that Topic C - Wallet Unit Attestation has not yet been drafted and the following is based on assumptions on content</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Topic C - Wallet Unit Attestations (WUA) And Key Attestations discusses how the Wallet Unit can document its functional and security capabilities, e.g., support for secure hardware, revocation status, etc. </p>
<p>Certain WUA elements are somewhat sensitive, as they may allow for linkability, and are only intended for PID and Attestation Providers, when performing issuance. Other parts of the WUA is used to prove that the Wallet Unit has not been revoked. This information is less sensitive and is intended for Relying Parties.</p>
<p>When a Wallet Unit and Relying Party performs registration of a pseudonym, key material will be stored on the Wallet Unit. This can be seen as a special case of issuance, in which the Relying Party acts the issuer and will be interested in what security guarantees the Wallet Unit can provide. Topic C should distinguish between a Relying Party acting as a Relying Party and Pseudonym issuer.</p>
<p>There are two main areas of Topic C that are particularly relevant in relation to Pseudonyms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Wallet Trust Evidence:</strong> Part of the WUA contains information on functional and cryptographic capabilities of the Wallet Unit (currently known as WTE). HRL WTE_24 <em>A Wallet Instance SHALL release a WTE only to a PID Provider or Attestation Provider, and not to a Relying Party or any other party.</em> states that an RP must not receive WTE information from the WU, however this prohibits a number of the HRLs related to issuance. Essentially, only the <em>Self Attestation</em> and <em>No Attestation</em> attestation types mentioned in Chapter 4.2.1 can be supported without access to WTE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revocation:</strong> Pseudonyms are local to each Relying Party, which makes revocation somewhat easy: The Relying Party can simply invalidate the pseudonym locally and the Wallet Unit will no longer be able to access that Relying Party. This revocation will not affect other functionality of the Wallet Unit, e.g., other Pseudonyms, PID and attestations will remain valid. In addition to local revocation, it may be desireable for the Relying Party to be able to revoke the entire Wallet Unit. If this functionality is to be supported, there must be some kind of attestation (see Chapter 4.2.1) in place. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="521-questions-related-to-wallet-unit-attestation">5.2.1 Questions Related to Wallet Unit Attestation</h4>
<p>Below, we list open questions that must still be clarified related to the interaction with WUA.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Should a Relying Party be able to revoke more than just local pseudonyms?</p>
<h3 id="53-digital-credential-api">5.3 Digital Credential API</h3>
<p>As stated in Chapter 4, [WebAuthN] does not specify the interface between the Wallet Units (i.e., Authenticators) and the Client used by the user to initiate the usage of the pseudonyms.
Discussion Topic F must also take into account providing a seamless integration for the use of pseudonyms.</p>
<h3 id="54-relation-to-risk-register">5.4 Relation to Risk Register</h3>
<p>As pseudonyms may be used to provide authentication, a large number of the risks listed
in the risk register for European Digital Identity Wallets [RiskRegister] are (at least indirectly)
related to the use of pseudonyms:</p>
