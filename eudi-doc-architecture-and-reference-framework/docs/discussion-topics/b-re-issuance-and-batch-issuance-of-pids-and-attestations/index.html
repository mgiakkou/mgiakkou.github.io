<h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="11-discussion-paper-topic-description">1.1 Discussion Paper topic description</h3>
<p>This document is the Discussion Paper for eIDAS Coordination Group
regarding Topic B: Re-issuance and batch issuance of PIDs and
Attestations.</p>
<p>The ARF Development Plan [ARF_DevPlan] describes this Topic as
follows:</p>
<p><em>High-level requirements on re-issuance and batch issuance need to be
discussed, as this topic is currently not addressed in the ARF. For
example, requirements around authentication of the User and re-use of
existing private keys may be different for first-time issuance and
re-issuance, batch issuance or synchronous issuance of an attestation</em></p>
<h3 id="12-related-risks-in-the-risk-register">1.2 Related risks in the Risk Register</h3>
<p>The risk register for European Digital Identity Wallets [RiskRegister]
contains no risks regarding re-issuance. This is because the risk
register focuses on risks related to security and privacy, not on
operational issues such as the difference between first-time issuance
and re-issuance of attestations.</p>
<p>However, the risks mentioned in [Topic A] are related to the topic of this 
document as well. This is because regular re-issuance of PIDs and attestations 
is the main mitigation for the Relying Party linkability risks discussed in [Topic A].</p>
<h3 id="13-key-words">1.3 Key words</h3>
<p>This document uses the capitalized key words 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY'
as specified in RFC 2119, i.e., to indicate requirements,
recommendations and options specified in this document.</p>
<p>In addition, 'must' (non-capitalized) is used to indicate an external
constraint, for instance a self-evident necessity or a requirement that
is mandated by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a
capability, whereas other words, such as 'will', 'is' or 'are' are
intended as statements of fact.</p>
<h3 id="14-definitions">1.4 Definitions</h3>
<p>For the purpose of this document, the following definitions apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Administrative validity of a document</em>: the date up to which the attributes of 
the document are valid, which is represented as one of the attributes in the document. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: some documents do not have an administrative validity date (e.g., a diploma). </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Technical validity of attestation</em>: the date upon which the attestation is valid.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: attestations have a technical validity which is chosen based on risk analyses.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="15-document-structure">1.5 Document structure</h3>
<p>This document is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapter 2 discusses batch issuance and re-issuance of PIDs and
    attestations, as well as how these processes are supported by the
    [OpenID4VCI] specification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 3 discusses some of the reasons for re-issuance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 4 discusses some of the differences between first-time

<h2 id="2-re-issuance-and-batch-issuance-of-pids-and-attestations">2 Re-issuance and batch issuance of PIDs and attestations</h2>
<h3 id="21-description">2.1 Description</h3>
<p>Version 1.5 of the ARF contains a large number of requirements regarding
the issuance of PIDs and attestations, primarily in Topic 10/23 and also
in Topic 9. These requirements do not distinguish between the first time
a PID or attestation is issued and re-issuance of a PID or attestation
that is already present in a Wallet Unit. Neither do these requirements
explicitly address the topic of batch issuance.</p>
<p>Re-issuance means the replacement of a PID or attestation that already
exists in a Wallet Unit by a PID or attestation having the same document
type. Re-issuance is always performed by the same PID Provider or
Attestation Provider that issued the existing PID or attestation. The
value of the attributes in the new attestation will typically be the
same as in the original attestation. However, this is not required, the
PID Provider or Attestation Provider may change one or more attribute
values. Re-issuance, as described in this document, is only applied within 
the administrative validity of a document. As example, a mobile Driving Licence (mDL) 
has attestations which have a technical  validity  shorter than
administrative validity of the actual document (i.e., the driving licence): 
re-issuance is used for obtaining a "fresh" attestation, whereas the administrative
process for obtaining a new attestation that corresponds 
to a new driving licence is out of scope of this document. </p>
<p>Batch issuance means that instead of issuing a single PID or attestation
to a Wallet Unit, a PID Provider or Attestation Provider issues a batch of them.
All PIDs or attestations in a batch have the same document type,
attribute values and validity period. In general, if the original PID or
attestation was issued in a batch, then the PID Provider or Attestation
Provider will re-issue that PID or attestation in a batch as well.</p>
<h3 id="22-support-by-openid4vci">2.2 Support by OpenID4VCI</h3>
<p>The ARF requires that Wallet Units, PID Providers, and Attestation
Providers use the [OpenID4VCI] specification for issuance of PIDs and
attestations (ISSU_01). [OpenID4VCI] supports re-issuance of attestations
through so-called Refresh Tokens. These are tokens that are optionally
issued during the first-time issuance of a PID or attestation, next to
the Access Tokens used in OpenID4VCI to protect access to the PID
Provider or Attestation Provider. When the Wallet Unit needs to request
re-issuance of a PID or attestation, it must start the process by
exchanging the Refresh Token for a new Access Token.</p>
<p>Given the reasons for re-issuance discussed in the next chapter, it
seems reasonable to assume that re-issuance should be possible for any PID
or attestation issued to a Wallet Unit. An Attestation Rulebook shall indicate if
re-issuance shall be supported for a specific PID or attestation.
To this end, the ARF will recommend that during first-time issuance of a PID or 
attestation that supports re-issuance, each Access Token shall be
accompanied by a corresponding Refresh Token.</p>
<p>The [OpenID4VCI] specification also supports batch issuance of
attestations, by optionally including multiple public keys and proofs of
possession in the proofs parameter in the Credential Request. ARF explicitly
requires support for this functionality (ISSU_04)</p>
<p>Given the discussions in [Topic A], it seems reasonable to assume that
batch issuance is in many cases desirable. 
An Attestation Rulebook shall indicate if batch issuance shall be used for a 
specific PID or attestation.</p>
<h2 id="3-reasons-for-re-issuance">3 Reasons for re-issuance</h2>
<h3 id="31-overview">3.1 Overview</h3>
<p>There may be different reasons for re-issuing a PID or attestation, for
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The current PID(s) or attestation(s) are near the end of their
    technical validity period, or the Wallet Unit is running out of once-only
    attestations. See section 3.2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value of one or more of the attributes in the PID or attestation
    has changed. See section 3.3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The security architecture of the Wallet Solution may use PIDs and/or
    attestations that are issued just-in-time, at the moment that PID or
    attestation is being requested by a Relying Party. This is sometimes
    called synchronous issuing. See section 3.4.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main reason for batch issuance of PIDs or attestations within the
EUDI Wallet ecosystem is to (partly) mitigate Relying Party linkability.
For this, see [Topic A].</p>
<h3 id="32-pid-or-attestation-nearing-its-end-of-technical-validity-or-wallet-unit-running-out-of-pids-or-attestations">3.2 PID or attestation nearing its end of technical validity or Wallet Unit running out of PIDs or attestations</h3>
<p>As specified in [ISO/IEC 18013-5] or [SD-JWT VC], each PID or
attestation contains metadata indicating its technical validity period.
Determining the length of the technical validity period is the responsibility of
the PID Provider or the Attestation Provider; neither these standards,
nor the ARF, nor the PID Rulebook specify anything about this. The
technical validity period chosen by the PID Provider or Attestation Provider will
depend on several factors, primarily the security architecture of the
Wallet Solution and the strategy chosen to mitigate Relying Party
linkability, as discussed in [Topic A].</p>
<p>Given the above factors, it can generally be assumed that the technical validity
period of a PID or attestations will be much shorter than the administrative 
validity of the corresponding document,
meaning the period of time that a User wants to keep that PID or
attestation in their Wallet Unit. That implies that new PIDs and
attestations will need to be issued periodically, to replace the ones
that are reaching their end of technical validity.</p>
<p>A similar reason for re-issuing PIDs and attestations occurs when the
PID Provider or Attestation Provider uses once-only attestations (as
defined in [Topic A]), which can be presented only once to a Relying
Party. In that case, the Wallet Unit will regularly need new PIDs or
attestations, to avoid running out.</p>
<p>Re-issuance of PIDs or attestations for these reasons is a purely
technical matter. To the maximum extent possible, the User should not
notice that a PID or attestation has been re-issued, nor should they
have to take any action to ensure that re-issuance happens in time.
Nevertheless, re-issuance events should be logged as stated in DASH_02, and 
a User should be able to access the this log (DASH_02b). 
These conditions are very different from a first-time issuance of a PID
or attestation, where the User must take the initiative to request the
PID or attestation, and is potentially involved in the process in other
ways as well. These aspects are discussed in chapter 4.</p>
<h3 id="33-a-change-in-attribute-values">3.3 A change in attribute values</h3>
<p>During the lifetime of a PID or attestation, the value of some of the
attributes may change. For example, at the date of birth of the User, an
age attestation attribute (i.e., an attribute indicating whether the
User has reached a certain age) may have to be changed from value False
to value True. In another example, the User of a mobile driving licence
may have passed the examination for a different vehicle category, or,
conversely, have lost the right to drive because of medical reasons or
severe traffic violations.</p>
<p>Re-issuance of a PID or attestation for this reason will have an impact
on the User, because they will notice that their attribute values have
been changed. In this case Users should consent.</p>
<h3 id="34-synchronous-issuing">3.4 Synchronous issuing</h3>
<p>A third reason for re-issuing a PID or attestation is where the PID
Provider or Attestation Provider uses synchronous issuing. In such an
architecture, the Wallet Unit requests the issuance of a new PID or
attestation after it has received a request for that PID or attestation
from a Relying Party. In such an architecture, the PID or attestation is
very short-lived and is used only once.</p>
<p>Within the scope of this document, this reason for re-issuance is very
similar to the reasons discussed in section 3.2. Users should not notice
that a PID or attestation is being re-issued, nor should they have to
take any action to ensure that re-issuance happens. However, they should
be offered the option to receive notifications, as well as to disable this
processes. Similarly, re-issuance events should be logged. </p>
<h2 id="4-differences-between-first-time-issuance-and-re-issuance-or-batch-issuance">4 Differences between first-time issuance and re-issuance or batch issuance</h2>
<h3 id="41-user-authentication-by-pid-provider-or-attestation-provider">4.1 User authentication by PID Provider or Attestation Provider</h3>
<p>In [Topic A] a high-level requirement was established that, to the
maximum extent possible, Users will not be involved in managing the
re-issuance of new attestations. This is an important principle.
Requiring that the User is involved in re-issuance processes would mean
that a User is requested to perform actions that they did not initiate,
and for which they probably don't understand the reason. This would lead
at least to a bad user experience, and most likely also to operational
problems, such as Users not cooperating. Users may start to distrust
their Wallet Unit if it unexpectedly keeps asking the User to
authenticate, or if they are not able to present their PIDs or
attestations because they (perhaps unknowingly) blocked a request for
re-issuance.</p>
<p>The requirement of non-involvement of Users in re-issuance processes has
implications for PID Providers and Attestation Providers. One of these
implications is that the requirements regarding User authentication will
be different for first-time issuance and re-issuance. At least for PID
Providers, and for many Attestation Providers as well, it is required to
identify and authenticate the User during a first-time issuance process.
For PID Providers, it is even required to authenticate the User on Level
of Assurance High. However, for re-issuance process, performing User
authentication is not possible if the User must not be involved.</p>
<p>If the User is not authenticated during re-issuance process, there is a
risk that the PID Provider or Attestation Provider issue the new PID or
attestation to the wrong person. To prevent this, they will have to
implement alternative security mechanisms. One option for this is to
require that the Refresh Tokens used by [OpenID4VCI] are bound to the
same WSCA to which the existing PID or attestation is bound. This can be
done by requiring that OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof of Possession
(DPoP) [RFC 9449] is used for these tokens, and that the public key in
the DPoP proof matches the public key in (one of) the PID(s) or
attestation(s) issued to the Wallet Unit previously.</p>
<p>Such a mechanism is common in managing certificate signing requests in
Public Key Infrastructures. It means that PID Providers or Attestation
Providers can be sure that the new PID or attestation will be bound to
the same WSCA, and thus to the same User, as the existing one.</p>
<p>For first-time batch issuance of PIDs or attestations, it seems
reasonable to require that the User needs to authenticate towards the
PID Provider or attestation provider only once, regardless of the size
of the batch, i.e., the number of PIDs or attestations issued
simultaneously to the Wallet Unit.</p>
<h3 id="42-user-authentication-and-key-management-by-the-wsca">4.2 User authentication and key management by the WSCA</h3>
<p>The ARF v1.4 (and v1.5 as well) contains a requirement (WTE_02 /
WUA_02) stating that "a WSCA SHALL authenticate the User before
performing any cryptographic operation involving a private or secret key
of (...) a PID or an attestation in a Wallet Unit."</p>
<p>If Users must not be aware of re-issuance processes for their existing
PIDs and attestations, this requirement may be problematic. This is
because the ARF assumes that each PID or attestation is bound to a key
pair that is generated by the WSCA. Therefore, for every new PID or
attestation, the WSCA must generate a new key pair. And key pair
generation is a cryptographic operation that, per the requirement above,
requires User authentication.</p>
<p>A solution for this challenge could be sought in several directions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By changing requirement WUA_02, such that it does not apply to key
    generation operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By allowing re-use of existing key pairs, meaning that the PID
    Provider or Attestation uses the same public key in multiple PIDs or
    attestations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By relying on a Hierarchical Deterministic Key (HDK) function as
    described in clause 4.4.4.2 of [ETSI 119476]. 
    Using a HDK function, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider only 
    needs to obtain a single public key from the WSCA, along with 
    non-sensitive metadata required to apply HDK. This happens during 
    first-time issuance of a first PID or attestation, where the User is involved in 
    the process anyway and a request to authenticate will not come unexpectedly. 
    During re-issuance or (batch) issuance of associated PID or attestations, 
    the PID Provider or Attestation Provider then uses this public 
    key to derive unique per-attestation public keys from the received public key,
    without involvement of the Wallet Unit or the WSCA. These newly derived 
    public keys are then sent to the Wallet Unit, along with non-sensitive 
    metadata required to apply HDK, and the WSCA can effectively derive 
    the corresponding private keys from the existing private 
    key (i.e. the one generated during first-time issuance). The WSCA then
    uses these private keys as normal during a presentation of
    attributes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By using WSCA to authenticate Users before using the Wallet Unit. 
Requirement WUA_03 states that "A Wallet Unit SHALL authenticate the User 
before performing any operation excluding cryptographic operations. The Wallet 
Unit MAY rely on a WSCA to do so (...)". Therefore, the WSCA may perform
the necessary cryptographic operations immediately after authenticating the
user on the Wallet Unit behalf. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 1 may not count as a good solution. Cryptographic key generation
by the WSCA is a sensitive operation, and it seems unwise to allow this
to happen without User authentication, if we can avoid that. Also, it is
not clear whether all types of WSCA (such a remote HSMs but also
embedded secure element) can be made to operate in such a way that they
require User authentication before signing and key agreement operations,
but not before key generation operations.</p>
<p>Option 2 entails multiple risks and should be avoided.</p>
<p>Option 3 seems promising, but Hierarchical Deterministic Keys have not
been part of the ARF before. If we want to require support from Wallet
Units and Attestation Providers for this technology, it needs to be
further investigated. High Level Requirements for this option will be
provided in a future specification.</p>
<p>Option 4 is currently the recommended approach. For this reason
WUA_02 and WUA_03 will be merged, and Wallet Units will be required to authenticate
Users using WSCA. </p>
<p>Requirement WUA_02 may also be problematic for batch issuance, if it
means that User authentication is required before generation of an
individual key pair. That would mean that for a batch of 20 PIDs or
attestations, the User would be required to authenticate 20 times. This
is clearly not acceptable from a user experience point of view,
especially not since the User is not even aware of the concept of batch
issuance, nor of the reasons for it.</p>
<p>However, ARF 1.5.0 already contains the following note to requirement
WUA_02: "Many actions of the Wallet Instance, such as processing a
Relying Party request and presenting an attestation, require multiple
cryptographic operations, for example ephemeral key generation followed
by key agreement and message encryption. This requirement does not imply
that separate User authentication is necessary before each of these
operations. Rather, a successful User authentication will be valid for
all cryptographic operations necessary for a Wallet Unit action. It is
up to the Wallet Provider to determine what constitutes a 'Wallet Unit
action', finding a balance between security (more User authentications)
and User convenience (fewer User authentications). During certification
of the Wallet Solution, it will be verified that the solution provides
an adequate level of security."</p>
<p>A new requirement has been added related to that (Requirement 6).</p>
<h3 id="43-triggers-for-the-issuance-process">4.3 Triggers for the issuance process</h3>
<p>The process of first-time issuance of a PID or attestation is triggered
by the User, who wants to obtain a PID or attestation and triggers the
Wallet Unit to start the process specified in [OpenID4VCI]. If we take
the requirement that Users are not involved in re-issuance processes
absolutely, trusting on the User to trigger re-issuance is not an
option. That leaves two parties that could potentially do this: the PID
Provider or Attestation Provider, or the Wallet Unit.</p>
<p>However, it is not clear how the PID Provider or Attestation Provider
can trigger the Wallet Unit to start the re-issuance processes. A Wallet
Provider will typically be able to send a push message to a Wallet Unit,
which will cause the Wallet Unit to contact the Wallet Provider's
backend to look for any updates or other actions. But PID Providers and
Attestation Providers are different from Wallet Providers, generally
speaking, and will typically not have this option.</p>
<p>Therefore, it seems better to require that the Wallet Unit triggers the
process of re-issuing a PID or attestation, for example when the
existing PID or attestation is near the end of its validity period, or
when the Wallet Unit is running out of once-only PIDs or attestations.
[Topic A] already contains the appropriate requirements.</p>
<p>Note that these requirements do not apply when synchronous issuance is
used. In that case, the Wallet Unit triggers the re-issuance of a PID or
attestation when attributes from that PID or attestation are requested
by a Relying Party.</p>
<p>Finally, the situation where re-issuance is necessary because of a
change in the value of one or more of the attributes. This is more
complicated, because the Wallet Unit does not have a way to know when
this happens. There basically seem to be three options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Wallet Unit sends at regular intervals a request to the PID
    Provider or Attestation Provider, to see if an updated version of
    the PID or attestation is available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PID Provider or Attestation Provider contacts the Wallet
    Provider to trigger the Wallet Unit to request re-issuance of the
    PID or attestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PID Provider or Attestation Provider contacts the User via an
    out-of-band communication channel to inform them that they need to
    request an update of their PID or attestation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attestation provider revokes the attestation, if attribute values 
    are out-of-date. Thus the wallet unit can monitor the revocation status 
    of the attestation and trigger a re-issuance when it detects that the 
    attestation is revoked</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 1 has obvious drawbacks, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(Potentially) millions of Wallet Units sending such information
    requests, in most cases probably for nothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, the PID Provider or Attestation would have to determine
    the frequency of such requests, which is not trivial. Too low a
    frequency may mean that the User does not receive the updated
    version of their PID or attestation in time i.e., before the new
    values become valid. Too high a frequency increases the load on the
    systems of the PID Provider or Attestation Provider unnecessarily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, such a request, and also the PID Provider or Attestation
    Provider endpoint to which it can be addressed, have not been
    specified yet. Option 4 is probably a solution to that. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Option 2 requires direct communication between the Wallet Provider and
the PID Provider or Attestation Provider. The ARF v1.5 does not foresee
such communication, primarily since it means that the Wallet Provider
gets information about the PIDs and attestations present on each of
their Wallet Units. From an architecture point of view, this would
therefore be a major change. Furthermore, this option introduces
privacy risks. On the other hand, the Commission has received
feedback several times stating that in the long run, when the EUDI
Wallet ecosystem is successful and a PID Provider or Attestation
Provider will have millions of subscribers, the current issuance model
will be unsustainable anyway. This is because remotely issuing and
managing millions of attestations, residing on mobile devices that are
controlled by their User, requires specialized knowledge and a dedicated
infrastructure that will not be easy to deploy for many PID Providers or
Attestation Providers. If true, this would mean that these Providers
will outsource this task to the Wallet Providers. They will send the
PIDs or attestations containing the new attribute values to the Wallet
Provider, and the Wallet Provider would be responsible for delivering
these PIDs or attestations to the respective Wallet Unit in time.
Obviously, the attribute values would be encrypted, such that the Wallet
Provider cannot read them. In conclusion this option should not yet be
considered. It should be re-examined if such an interface is defined.</p>
<p>Option 3 violates the principle that the User is not involved in the
re-issuance of PIDs or attestations. In this case, however, that is
defensible, since the User will (have to) note the changed attribute
value anyway. This approach nevertheless has some drawbacks as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is only usable if during the first-time issuance of the PID or
    attestation, the PID Provider or Attestation Provider captured
    contact information of the User, such as a telephone number or
    e-mail address. This may not be the case for all attestations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The User may have objections to the update of their PID or
    attestations. Section 3.3 already gave the example of a User having
    lost the right to drive because of medical reasons or severe traffic
    violations. Such a User may refuse to trigger the re-issuance
    process because they want to continue using their existing PID or
    attestation with the 'old' values. Obviously, the PID Provider or
    Attestation Provider can (and should) revoke the existing PID or
    attestation. But this implies that they should have a policy
    determining how they will deal with situations like this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of this option, as long as it does not involve the Wallet Unit for
delivering such a notification is left as an implementation choice. </p>
<p>Option 4 should be the recommended approach. Option 4 is similar to Option 1
but it does not suffer by the lack of a PID Provider or Attestation
Provider endpoint. However, depending on the revocation reason, re-issuance
of an attestation may not succeed: Wallet Solutions should be able to handle this
condition. </p>
<h3 id="44-handling-existing-pids-or-attestations-after-re-issuance-of-new-ones">4.4 Handling existing PIDs or attestations after re-issuance of new ones</h3>
<p>In general, re-issuance of a PID or attestation will take place when the existing PID or 
attestation is still valid. If that were not the case, there would be a time window where 
User does not have any valid PIDs or attestations that they can present to Relying Parties.</p>
<p>After successful re-issuance of a PID or attestation, the Wallet Unit must delete the 
existing PID or attestation, meaning the one that the re-issued PID or attestation 
intends to replace. This is for a simple reason: the value of some of the attributes 
in the new PID or attestation may be different from the value in the existing one. 
And obviously, the Wallet Unit must not present attestations containing attribute 
values that the Wallet Provider no longer wants to attest to.</p>
