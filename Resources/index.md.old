# EUDI Wallet Resources

To support your introduction to the EUDI Wallet, we’ve gathered essential resources that provide a comprehensive foundation. Dive into technical specifications, explore the regulatory framework, and gain insights from real-world pilot projects. These materials are designed to help you understand the EUDI Wallet from all critical perspectives.

## Ensure compliance with the EUDI Wallet Regulation

Understand the regulatory framework that underpins the development and deployment of the EU Digital Identity Wallet. This regulation outlines the legal requirements necessary to guarantee the wallet’s secure, interoperable, and cross-border functionality.

[Regulation (EU) 2024/1183](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32024R1183){:target="_blank"} establishing the European Digital Identity Framework has entered into force. The framework mandates Member States to provide EU Digital Identity (eID) Wallets to citizens within 24 months of Implementing Acts adoption. 

All the [Implementing Acts](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/implementing-regulation-european-digital-identity-wallets){:target="_blank"} that have been adopted until now, and lay down the rules for the core functionalities and certification of the eID Wallets. 

## Master the Architecture and Reference Framework

Discover the key specifications and guidelines needed to develop an interoperable EUDI Wallet solution. This framework provides a solid foundation based on common standards and best practices to ensure seamless integration and functionality. 

The Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) outlines the specifications required to develop an interoperable European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet Solution based on common standards and practices. It defines high-level requirements to ensure consistent implementation across Member States.

The Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) is a work in progress that is continuously updated. It reflects the collaborative efforts among the 27 Member States, the European Commission, and, where relevant, private sector operators.

## Delve into the applicable Technical Standards and Specifications

Compliance with established standards is essential for the security, interoperability, and reliability of the EUDI Wallet. The European Digital Identity Wallet initiative is supported by ongoing work to define and align relevant standards and technical specifications with the relevant Implementing Acts establishing the European Digital Identity Framework. For more information, please refer to the following resources:

## Explore the Large-Scale Pilots shaping the EUDI Wallet

In May 2023, four Large-Scale Pilot projects were launched to rigorously test and prepare the EU Digital Identity Wallet for secure and seamless deployment. These Pilots involve approximately 360 entities, including private companies and public authorities, from 26 Member States, Norway, Iceland, and Ukraine. The projects are co-funded by European Commission grants and guided by EUDI Wallet technical specifications. Running until 2025, the pilots are structured as consortia, combining public and private sector expertise across the EU.

The Pilots aim to validate the wallet's functionality in real-life scenarios, by gathering feedback on the reference implementation to enhance its security, interoperability, and overall design. These efforts focus on practical use cases that Europeans encounter daily, spanning 11 key areas such as accessing government services, opening bank accounts, and facilitating travel.

## Discover the EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation

The EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation consists of open-source code libraries and a reference application, which are publicly available and ready for Member States and stakeholders to use in building their own applications.

Its goal is to showcase a robust and interoperable platform for digital identification, authentication and electronic signatures based on common standards across the European Union.

The Reference Implementation can be used by wallet providers, issuers and Relying Parties as a basis for their own solution. It also includes a set of testing tools to support testing and ensure that your implementation meets functional requirements.
